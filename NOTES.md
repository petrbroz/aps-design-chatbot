- Not sure if RAG is the best option for a design data chatbot
- _LLMs cannot count_ - they may have learned from training data that what typically follows after "1+1=" is "2" but they don't actually do any math
- For structured data, how about using LLMs to generate actual queries and executing them?
- For example, if the data is in a SQL database, use the LLM to:
  - turn user questions into SQL queries
  - turn SQL results into answers
- See https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/
- Problem: design data in APS isn't _completely_ structured
